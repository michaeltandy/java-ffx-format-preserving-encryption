Java implementation of the FFX\[radix\] algorithm from [Addendum to “The FFX Mode of Operation for Format Preserving Encryption”](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/BCM/documents/proposedmodes/ffx/ffx-spec2.pdf) by Mihir Bellare, Phillip Rogaway, and Terence Spies, September 3rd 2010.

It's tested against the [AES FFX Test Vector Data provided by Voltage Security](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/BCM/documents/proposedmodes/ffx/aes-ffx-vectors.txt).
